The further the years of the Great Patriotic War go, the more important it seems to me to show the connection of military episodes with the decisions of the high command, with the facts of the country's life at all stages of the war. During the period of the determined general offensive of the Soviet Army, the actions of even a platoon were part of the strategic tactical plan of victory. In such a connection lies one of the keys to success and a clearer understanding of what happened. Therefore, I will provide fragments from the book by Martyn Merzhanov "Soldier, General, Marshal (about Bagramyan and others)". Politizdat, Moscow, 1974.

\label{2-3}
In July 1944, "Pravda" wrote:
"Along the central streets of Moscow, under the escort of Soviet soldiers, 57,600 prisoners captured in Belarus marched.

\pageimage{page_003}
\label{3-1}
captured in Belarus. At the head of the giant column, with their heads down, moved German generals and officers... They triumphantly marched through many capitals of Europe: Warsaw, Paris, Prague, Belgrade, Athens, Amsterdam, Brussels, and Copenhagen. Their dream was to march through Moscow in the same way. And here they were walking through it, but not as victors, but as the defeated... The prisoners marched past the silent, angry Muscovites, who stood in dense rows on the sidewalks. (p. 81) The prisoners who passed by, in terms of numbers, constituted more than four rifle divisions. An impressive force. So the July march was a visible testimony of the coming victory, a moral stimulus for the war-weary Soviet people. At that time, May 9 was nothing more than a date on the calendar. Despite the clear advantage in favor of the Soviet Army, the war was fierce, and the enemy tried to turn the tide. Bagramyan assumed that the Germans would hold the Baltics to the last. This task had not only strategic but also political significance for them. Relying on the well-equipped defensive lines created here, the command of the Army Group "North" could free up a sufficient number of troops to counteract the forces of the 1st Baltic Front. (p. 82) The upcoming operation was associated with difficulties that arose due to the counterattacks of the Germans. On July 20, 1944, the offensive of the front's strike group began in the Šiauliai direction. The troops relatively quickly overcame the first defensive line and moved forward. (pp. 83, 85) In the book by M. Moshinov. (p. 86)

\label{4-1}

Let us pay attention to another significant fact that happened on the same day, July 20, but on the other side of the front. That night, when the front commander General Bagramyan and Chief of Staff General Kurasov finally polished all the details of the Šiauliai operation, in East Prussia, in the Rastenburg area, at Hitler's headquarters - the so-called "Wolf's Lair" - 300 kilometers from the headquarters of the 1st Baltic Front, the head of the operations department of the general staff, General A. Heusinger, was also sitting over a map. He was preparing to report to the Führer, scheduled for noon on July 20... At that very second, a deafening explosion occurred. Hitler crawled out from under the table that had fallen on him. He received burns and minor injuries. (pp. 85-86) Our troops were moving west. The Germans felt the proximity of East Prussia and the edge of the earth - the shore of the Baltic Sea. On the second day after the start of the offensive, the city of Panevėžys was liberated, and soon after, Šiauliai. On the same day, after fierce battles, the troops of the 2nd Baltic Front and the 6th Guards Army of General Chistyakov captured Daugavpils. After the liberation of Šiauliai, the enemy feverishly intensified resistance. (p. 86) A series of large-scale events was approaching my special date, July 24, 1944, which I am telling about. Early morning. The front line. The reconnaissance returned. It checked, in particular, the situation in the neutral area from which the offensive was to continue. Shortly before that, the 6th Guards Army had joined the 1st Baltic Front. In this operation, it interacted with the troops of the 2nd Baltic Front.

The returning scouts brought us hot, delicious porridge with butter, sweet tea, and bread in shoulder thermoses. We ate unhurriedly, checked our weapons again, someone carefully lit a cigarette, and everyone fell silent; we were waiting for the order to move to the starting positions. I was a junior lieutenant (after graduating from the one-year Tula Machine Gun and Mortar School), commander of a rifle platoon - 517th Rifle Red Banner Regiment, 166th Guards Division, 8th Guards Army. The situation at the level of the rifle-infantry platoon was as follows: The neutral zone ran at an angle. The line of our front edge was slightly elevated above a narrow field, which on the opposite side abutted a young sparse forest. We had to descend into the forest, cross it, and lie down behind a low earthen rampart - the attack line. Close to the rampart, on the side away from us, was a narrow drainage ditch. Beyond the rampart, directly towards the Germans, there was also a small field about 120 meters long in the direction of our advance.

\pageimage{page_006}
\label{6-1}

This field had a slight slope, but towards us (which is bad for advancing infantry). On the German side, the field bordered with bushes, old trees, the side wall of a long log farm building (barn or shed), and a little to the right - a large tank on high metal supports. These two objects - the building and the tank - could be quickly turned into well-protected firing points. This was part of the German defense line. This was the disposition, the place of our platoon in the battle, I show everything in the plan.

\pageimage{page_007}
\label{7-1}
The advance to the starting positions went quickly and calmly. We entered the young forest in full combat readiness. As we approached the earthen rampart, the enemy opened fire, as it seemed, along the wide front of the advancing army. Our entire platoon dived to the rampart. No one was hurt. We instantly returned fire. The force of pressing the trigger, the killing power of the bullet, seemed to multiply by the force of hatred for fascism, for Hitler. We fired bursts at the most likely, reliable enemy firing points. We were well prepared for the attack. In the neighboring platoon was the company commander (which meant that section was more difficult). They also thoroughly rinsed the enemy's position, and we simultaneously rose to the attack: in an instant, we jumped over the earthen rampart, the ditch, and rushed forward. The peculiarity of the battle was that the distance between our and the German positions, I repeat, was minimal. This meant that we had to shake the enemy's confidence in the reliability of their defense, and most importantly, by intensifying close-range fire, drive them out of their positions. The reasons for this type of infantry attack arose because,

\pageimage{page_008}
\label{8-1}
if the enemy withstood the hell of the concentrated firepower of divisions and armies, they entrenched themselves on intermediate defense lines and tried to hold back the onslaught of the advancing Soviet Army. For this, they hastily built defenses and pushed a man with a rifle (usually rifle units) to the front line of their defense. The Germans retreated but did not flee, so the task was to prevent the enemy from consolidating on intermediate positions, to drive out the man with the rifle, and to push the enemy to the lines and times set in the operational plans of the high command. This was the task. In such operations, the infantry put the final point. This was its irreplaceability, strength, and sacrifice. We attacked and fired short bursts of automatic fire on the run to limit the enemy's return fire and not slow down the pace of the attack. (Explanation: at a short distance, and even on open terrain with a slope, even a slight one, but...

\pageimage{page_009}
\label{9-1}
for the enemy, a "classic" attack - lying down and short dashes with firing - is practically excluded. The attackers are well visible, immobile. A quick dash and concentrated fire on a narrow strip of the line attacked by the platoon are needed. And so it was. As the short distance was quickly overcome, the fire increased, but worse for them, the attacking infantry was near their positions. However, in the general noise of the battle, bullets took our soldiers out of action. At some ten meters, something flat, hard hit me very hard on the right, knocked me off my feet. The blow was so strong that the moment of falling was not recorded in my consciousness.

\label{9-2}
The sensation began to return with a continuous hum, darkness, and a peculiar wind in my head. All this seemed to pull me into some distance, to a bright spot. At some point, my eyes opened. I was lying face down in a pool of blood. Burning pain in my mouth, on my face, in my right shoulder. By the head...

\pageimage{page_010}
\label{10-1}
lay my PPSh submachine gun (Shpagin submachine gun), with peripheral vision I saw pieces of torn cheek, from which clots of blood were dripping; there was no right forearm: a mess of meat and blood held the forehead on a piece of torn sleeve of the tunic, and on the dark blue vein horror gripped me: am I really dying, will I really not see my Moscow?!

\label{10-2}
Moscow did not appear to me as family or a childhood home — I was 19 years old, and by that time, my parents had passed away. Moscow appeared at that moment as a cozy corner of Pushkin Square, where the monument to the great poet stood (in its original place), along with a plaster statue of a ballerina on the roof of a then-new corner building on Gorky Street.

\label{10-3}
Confusion, shock were replaced by the restoration of consciousness, although there was a loud noise in my head and pounding in my temples, clots of blood pressed on my throat, I continuously swallowed them. However, the fear of death was replaced by the desire to survive. I carefully turned on my left shoulder, leaned on the left part of my back, pulled my right hand with my left hand, then dragged the field bag and wrapped the torn hand with the strap; in search of some relief from the pain, I tried to remove the burning weight from my face, but my fingers touched my tongue. I decided to get out on my own. I didn't have time to...

\pageimage{page_011}
\label{11-1}
my actions, when seconds later I saw a nurse next to me. Kneeling, bending over without a word, she began to bandage my face, then twice tried to apply a tourniquet to my right forearm, the tourniquet did not hold. "We'll have to use a tight bandage," she said quietly, neither to me nor to herself, and opened the medical bag again. While the nurse was bandaging, I tried to clearly say the word "drink." She, of course, understood everything without my mumbling, and when she finished bandaging, she lifted two flasks, shook them slightly, and quietly, with great sympathy, said: "The wounded drank. Hold on, dear, we'll take you soon." Still staying low to the ground, the nurse crawled away. The tight bandages muffled the sensations of sharp pain, but the thirst tormented me: it seemed that there was a stinking, overripe footcloth in my mouth, which I was forced to suck... Half-lying on my back, I pulled the field bag with the strapped hand higher to my chest, hooked the strap of the submachine gun, and, leaning on my left elbow, began to crawl towards the forest...

\pageimage{page_012}
\label{12-1}
Maybe if I had drunk water, I would have stayed to wait for help. The nearby forest already seemed far away, but I crawled. I remember myself already in the medical company: it means the nurse returned, they carried me out. In the medical company, they filled me with the unforgettable charm of raw, cool water, gave the mandatory tetanus shot for all the wounded. Then - the operating room of the medical battalion.

\label{12-2}
- The medical company is the nearest medical point to the combat actions; it was located at the front positions; its function was to provide emergency assistance to the wounded and send them to the medical battalion.

\label{12-3}
The medical battalion is a full-fledged hospital complex deployed in combat conditions, becoming stationary as the army advanced; it was located deep in the front line at the level of auxiliary units of divisions and the army. From the medical battalion, operated-on severely wounded soldiers were sent through a chain of evacuation hospitals (EH) to the nearest restored railway, where hospital trains arrived. They transported the wounded to hospitals across the country; in the EH, the wounded stayed for 2-4 days, depending on the treatment process and their physical condition. The wounded were also transported by planes.

\pageimage{page_013}
\label{13-1}
It was night when I woke up from anesthesia. I saw myself in a large army tent. A dim light bulb glowed on the central support pole. A nurse sat at a small bedside table. Many cots, all with wounded. The flap of the tent entrance was thrown back, the smell of the forest wafted in. A special silence of the night. Not a shot, as if there was no war. My jaw was bandaged, covered with a sheet up to my neck. My arm?! I sharply pulled off the sheet. Wide bandages wrapped around my chest, and my right shoulder was wrapped in a thick bandage. "That's it. There will be no arm," I coldly said to myself and understood my new future. The nurse heard some movement, approached, covered me with the sheet again, said something encouraging, but I was no longer listening, as in the morning. It turned out I didn't know everything about that day - there was a third bullet. In the city of Ivanovo, where I was lying in a maxillofacial hospital, I first took my field bag after the injury and gasped: in the corner of its left edge was a bullet entry (simply put, a small hole), and at the exit, in the back thickened wall - a large cut, like with a knife; at the bottom of the bag lay a torn brass bullet casing and...

\label{14-1}
a flattened piece of lead, that's how an explosive bullet tears. To this day, I keep these items, which have become relics of the Great Patriotic War for me. The roads to victory over German Nazism were steep. Listening to the pure sounds of fanfares for the victors, let us honor those whose youth was forever frozen in that heavy war. I was awarded two Orders of the Patriotic War, first and second class, as well as the medal "For Victory over Germany" and commemorative jubilee medals of the USSR, RF, and Israel.
